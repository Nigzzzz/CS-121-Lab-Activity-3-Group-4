This Python-based Building Management System (BMS) allows users to manage and simulate different types of buildings, including "**Industrial**", "**Residential**", "**Agricultural**", and "**Warehouse**" types. 

**Features:**
- Abstract base "Building" class with shared properties
- Subclasses with specific attributes:
  - "Industrial_Building": handles machinery and labs
  - "Residential_Building": tracks residents, amenities, and emergency contacts
  - "Agricultural_Building": manages crops, livestock, and equipment storage
  - "Warehouse": stores and manages inventory with capacity tracking
- Validates user input (e.g., phone numbers, yes/no responses, integers)


**How to Run the Program:**

1. Make sure Python 3 is installed on your machine. You can check this by running: bash --> python --version
2. Save the code to a file named bms.py or any name you prefer.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the folder where the script is saved.
4. Run the script using: python bms.py


**Acknowledgements:**

We would like to thank Ms. Fatima Marie Agdon for her valuable guidance, support, and for providing the foundational knowledge in object-oriented programming that made this project possible.

Special thanks to our peers for the collaborative discussions, feedback, and encouragement throughout the development of this system.

This project was developed as part of our coursework in Python programming, inspired by real-world building management systems.
