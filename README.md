This Python-based Building Management System (BMS) allows users to manage and simulate different types of buildings, including "Industrial", "Residential", "Agricultural", and "Warehouse" types. 

Features:
- Abstract base "Building" class with shared properties
- Subclasses with specific attributes:
  - "Industrial_Building": handles machinery and labs
  - "Residential_Building": tracks residents, amenities, and emergency contacts
  - "Agricultural_Building": manages crops, livestock, and equipment storage
  - "Warehouse": stores and manages inventory with capacity tracking
- Validates user input (e.g., phone numbers, yes/no responses, integers)

How to Run the Program:

1. Make sure Python 3 is installed on your machine. You can check this by running: bash --> python --version
